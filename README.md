## Satalitte Physics Engine :
- This project was made back in 2021 so the THREE.js version was a little old, we made this project with full consideration of   how physics works in Real-world applications, the most challegning thing was coding almost everything from scratch espcially the angles of the z axis to the y axis, because we didn't have enough time to think through it but it works unconditionally fine. I learnt alot from this project to take myself to another level of thinking about simple things and then implementing them in the most real way possible.
- Finally this project take so much time and effort from us, So if you like it or did use it, kindly please leave a star on the repository

## Special Commands and GUI : 
- SPACE : Pause state (very important !)
- Left Click : Select a ball and show information on it
- Righ Clik : Add velocity ball throught the raycast hit with the START_SPEED specified on right DAT Control panel
- ESC: Swith Active/Inactive control of Free Cam (for FirstPersonControls.js specifically, but little buggy)

    Add a Big  (with bottom righ dat control GUI) on the scene center during or after the simulation. 

    Or change the main characteristics (Mass, direction, state, color..) of Planets/Particles in left control selection panel.
